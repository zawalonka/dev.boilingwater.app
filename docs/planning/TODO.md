## 🔴 CRITICAL PATH (Blocks Release)

### 1. Known Physics Bugs (PRIORITY FIX)
**Status:** IN PROGRESS | **25% Complete**  
**Last Step:** Identified burner heating issue in GameScene.jsx  
**Next:** Implement room heating calculation

**Burner Heating Logic Incorrect:**
- Burner only heats room when pot is over it; should act like mini-heater regardless
- Expected: 10% of burner power dissipates to room air continuously
- [ ] Add room heating calculation (independent of pot position)

**Dependencies:** None | **Unlocks:** Realistic room temperature feedback, accurate boiling point shifts

---

### 2. Time Speed Sub-stepping (Performance Critical)
**Status:** RESEARCHING | **5% Complete**  
**Impact:** At extreme speeds (65536x), physics diverges  
**Problem:** deltaTime = 6553.6s per step at 65536x → equations break down  

**⚠️ KEY FINDING (2026-02-03): Web Worker Approach May Be Better**
- Browser `setInterval` is throttled to ~4ms minimum (250 callbacks/sec max)
- Current TIME_STEP=100ms can't be reduced for finer accuracy at 1x speed
- **Web Worker solution:** Run physics on separate CPU thread = **10,000-50,000 steps/sec** (no browser throttling)
- Physics code is already pure functions → ZERO changes needed to move to worker
- Vite has built-in worker support → minimal refactor (~1-2 hours)

**See:** [TIME_STEPPING_TODO.md](TIME_STEPPING_TODO.md) for:
- Complete physics analysis and divergence explanation
- Web Worker research findings and implementation plan
- Browser setInterval limitations and why workers solve it
- Pipeline parallelism analysis (why it doesn't work for sequential physics)

**Implementation Options:**
1. **Web Worker** (NEW - most promising): Physics on separate thread. No browser throttling. Best accuracy + performance.
2. **Speed Cap** (simplest): Limit UI to 256x. Fast, proven, avoids divergence.
3. **Sub-stepping** (robust): Divide steps. Expensive CPU but mathematically correct.
4. **Adaptive Stepping** (sophisticated): Auto-adjust step sizes. Complex.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Research more on Web Workers (SharedArrayBuffer, message overhead, WASM option)
- [ ] Profile current physics loop execution time
- [ ] Choose approach (Worker vs Sub-stepping vs Speed Cap)
- [ ] Create `src/workers/physicsWorker.js` if choosing worker approach
- [ ] Create `src/utils/physics/timeSubstepper.js` if choosing sub-stepping
- [ ] Test at 1x, 256x, 65536x (verify no divergence)
- [ ] Profile performance impact

**Dependencies:** None | **Unlocks:** Reliable speed acceleration, finer accuracy at 1x, removes unreliability warning
