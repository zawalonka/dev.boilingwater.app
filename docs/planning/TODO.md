# Project TODO - Boiling Water App

> **Last Updated:** 2026-01-31  
> **Status:** Pre-Alpha (working prototype with zero-hardcoding substance system)
> **Completed items:** See [COMPLETED_TODOS.md](COMPLETED_TODOS.md)

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE: Current Sprint Tasks

### Test & Validate Recent Changes
- [ ] Test Level 2 dropdown (tutorial → Level 2 → verify dropdown works)
- [ ] Test element loading in-game (H, O, N and verify physics)
- [ ] Verify saltwater boiling at correct temperature (100.51°C at sea level, ~66.7°C at 10km)
- [ ] Test experiment-specific popups (L1E1-Tutorial, L1E2-Altitude, L1E3-Different Fluids)

### Add Antoine TminC/TmaxC Notes to Remaining JSON Files
**Priority:** Low (delegate to less expensive AI)  
**Template:** See `src/data/substances/compounds/pure/water-h2o/liquid/state.json` for example  
**Completed:** water-h2o, saltwater-3pct-nacl  
**Remaining files to update:**
- [ ] `compounds/pure/ethanol-c2h5oh/liquid/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/acetone-c3h6o/liquid/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/ammonia-nh3/liquid/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/ammonia-nh3/gas/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/methane-ch4/liquid/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/methane-ch4/gas/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/propane-c3h8/liquid/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/propane-c3h8/gas/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/glycerin-c3h8o3/liquid/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/isopropyl-alcohol-c3h8o/liquid/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/hydrogen-peroxide-h2o2/liquid/state.json`
- [ ] `compounds/pure/acetic-acid-ch3cooh/liquid/state.json`

**What to add:** Add `TminC_note` and `TmaxC_note` fields explaining that these are empirically verified range boundaries, not hard limits.

### Add Regression Guardrails
- [ ] Add physics guardrail checklist to DEVELOPMENT.md
  - No artificial clamps without physics justification
  - No static values for temperature-dependent properties
  - Dynamic calculation preferred over pre-computed constants

## 🚀 BACKLOG: Planned Features

### High Priority
1. **Unit Conversion System**
   - Wire UI, add more units, update all displays

2. **Room Environment & Atmospheric System** (Design complete)
   - Dynamic room temperature with PID-controlled AC
   - Air composition tracking (O₂, N₂, CO₂, toxic gases)
   - See [ROOM_ENVIRONMENT_SYSTEM.md](ROOM_ENVIRONMENT_SYSTEM.md)

3. **Experiment Scorecard System** (Design phase)
   - Downloadable CSV/JSON reports
   - Metrics: efficiency, sustainability, score

### Medium Priority
4. **Save Data & Persistence**
   - LocalStorage autosave
   - Console codes (portable)
   - File export/import

5. **Substance Documentation**
   - More JSDoc examples
   - Field documentation
   - Developer guides

### Low Priority (Visual)
6. **Alpha Kitchen Flame Icon Scaling**
   - Flame icon grows differently in alpha vs other workshops
   - Visual polish only

### Very Low Priority (Future/Nice-to-Have)
7. **Experiment Data Collection & AI Analysis System**
   - See [COMPLETED_TODOS.md](COMPLETED_TODOS.md) for full design notes
   - Local storage → Cloud aggregation → AI insights pipeline
   - Post-1.0 release feature
