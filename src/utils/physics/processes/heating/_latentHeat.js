/**
 * STUB: Latent Heat Formula (Phase Change Energy)
 * 
 * This process uses the latent heat equations to calculate energy for
 * phase changes (melting/boiling) where temperature stays constant.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Calculate how much energy goes into converting
 * liquid to vapor once the substance reaches boiling point.
 * 
 * @see ../../formulas/latentHeat.js for the actual implementation
