 * STUB: Heat Capacity Formula (Q = mcΔT)
 * 
 * This process uses the heat capacity equation to calculate how much
 * energy is needed to change a substance's temperature, or how much
 * the temperature changes when energy is applied.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Calculate temperature increase from burner
 * energy input, and energy needed to reach boiling point.
 * 
 * @see ../../formulas/heatCapacity.js for the actual implementation
