/**
 * STUB: Ebullioscopy (Boiling Point Elevation) Formula
 * 
 * This process uses the ebullioscopy equation (ΔTb = i × Kb × m) to calculate
 * how much dissolved solutes raise the boiling point of a solution.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Apply the final adjustment for solutions like
 * saltwater, sugar water, etc. Pure solvents have zero elevation.
 * 
 * @see ../../formulas/ebullioscopy.js for the actual implementation
