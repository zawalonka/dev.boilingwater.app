/**
 * STUB: Antoine Equation Formula
 * 
 * This process uses the Antoine equation to determine the temperature
 * at which a substance's vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Convert atmospheric pressure (from ISA) into
 * the base boiling point temperature for the pure solvent.
 * 
 * @see ../../formulas/antoineEquation.js for the actual implementation
