 * STUB: ISA Atmosphere Formula
 * 
 * This process uses the ISA (International Standard Atmosphere) formula
 * to convert altitude in meters to atmospheric pressure in Pascals.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Calculate what pressure the liquid experiences
 * at the given altitude, which determines its boiling point.
 * 
 * @see ../../formulas/isaAtmosphere.js for the actual implementation
