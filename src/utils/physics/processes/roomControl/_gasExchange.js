 * STUB: Gas Exchange Formula
 * 
 * This process uses the gas exchange equations to calculate how the
 * air handler changes room composition based on flow rate and efficiency.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Convert air handler flow rate to composition change.
 * 
 * @see ../../formulas/gasExchange.js for the actual implementation
