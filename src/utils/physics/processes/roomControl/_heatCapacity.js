 * STUB: Heat Capacity Formula (Q = mcΔT)
 * 
 * This process uses the heat capacity equation to calculate the actual
 * temperature change when AC heat/cooling power is applied to the room.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Convert AC watts to room temperature change.
 * 
 * @see ../../formulas/heatCapacity.js for the actual implementation
