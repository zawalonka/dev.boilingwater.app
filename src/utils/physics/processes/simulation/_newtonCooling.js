/**
 * STUB: Newton's Law of Cooling Formula
 * 
 * This process uses Newton's Law of Cooling to equilibrate the fluid
 * temperature toward ambient when the burner is off.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Make the fluid cool down realistically
 * when not being heated. Hot fluids cool faster than warm ones.
 * 
 * @see ../../formulas/newtonCooling.js for the actual implementation
