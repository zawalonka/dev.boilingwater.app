/**
 * STUB: Boiling Point Process
 * 
 * This process uses the boiling point calculation to determine the
 * temperature at which the fluid will boil at the current altitude.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Determine the boiling threshold each timestep.
 * The simulation needs to know when to stop increasing temperature
 * and start generating vapor.
 * 
 * @see ../boilingPoint/calculateBoilingPoint.js for the actual implementation
