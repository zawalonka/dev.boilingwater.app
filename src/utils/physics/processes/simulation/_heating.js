/**
 * STUB: Heating Process
 * 
 * This process uses the heat application to convert burner power (Watts)
 * into temperature change and/or vapor generation.
 * 
 * Purpose in this process: Apply the energy from the burner each timestep.
 * Energy = Power × Time, then apply to fluid.
 * 
 * @see ../heating/applyHeat.js for the actual implementation
