    "history": [
      "Hassium was first produced by Peter Armbruster, Gottfried Münzenber and their team working at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany in 1984. They bombarded atoms of lead-208 with ions of iron-58 with a device known as a linear accelerator. This produced atoms of hassium-265, an isotope with a half-life of about 2 milliseconds (0.002 seconds), and a free neutron. Hassium's most stable isotope, hassium-270, has a half-life of about 22 seconds. It decays into seaborgium-266 through alpha decay.",
      "Its name is Latin \"Hassias\" meaning \"Hess,\" from the German state. Discovered by Peter Armbruster, Gottfried Munzenber and co-workers at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany in 1984."

      "Hassium does not occur naturally in the Earth’s crust. Hassium was first synthesized by German scientists at the GSI Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany in 1984 using the nuclear reaction 208Pb (58Fe, n) 265Hs (Fig. IUPAC.108.1). The element is named for Hassia (the Latin name for the German state of Hesse), whose former capital was Darmstadt [651], [652], [653]. Hassium is used in chemical and heavy element research."
