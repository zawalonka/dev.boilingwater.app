      "The name derives from the Latin Tellus, who was the Roman goddess of the Earth. Tellurium was discovered by Franz Joseph Müller von Reichenstein in 1782 and overlooked for 15 years until it was isolated by the German chemist Martin-Heinrich Klaproth in 1798. The Hungarian chemist Paul Kitaibel independently discovered tellurium in 1789, prior to Klaproth's work but after von Reichenstein.",
      "Tellurium was discovered by Franz Joseph Müller von Reichenstein, a Romanian mining official, in 1782. Reichenstein was the chief inspector of all mines, smelters and saltworks in Transylvania. He also had an interest in chemistry and extracted a new metal from an ore of gold, known as aurum album, which he believed was antimony. He shortly realized that the metal he had produced wasn't antimony at all, but a previously unknown element. Reichenstein's work was forgotten until 1798 when Martin Heinrich Klaproth, a German chemist, mentioned the substance in a paper. Klaproth named the new element tellurium but gave full credit for its discovery to Reichenstein. Tellurium is found free in nature, but is most often found in the ores sylvanite (AgAuTe4), calaverite (AuTe2) and krennerite (AuTe2). Today, most tellurium is obtained as a byproduct of mining and refining copper.",
      "From the Latin word tellus, earth. Discovered by Muller von Reichenstein in 1782; named by Klaproth, who isolated it in 1798."

    "uses": [
      "Tellurium is a semiconductor and is frequently doped with copper, tin, gold or silver. Tellurium is also used to color glass and ceramics and is one of the primary ingredients in blasting caps.Tellurium is primarily used as an alloying agent. Small amounts of tellurium are added to copper and stainless steel to make them easier to machine and mill. Tellurium is also added to lead to increase its strength and resistance to sulfuric acid (H2SO4).Tellurium forms many compounds, but none that are commercially important. They include: tellourous acid (H2TeO2), tellurium tetrachloride (TeCl4), tellurium dichloride (TeCl2), tellurium trioxide (TeO3), tellurium monoxide (TeO) and sodium telluride (Na2Te).",
      "Tellurium improves the machinability of copper and stainless steel, and its addition to lead decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid on lead and improves its strength and hardness. Tellurium is used as a basic ingredient in blasting caps, and is added to cast iron for chill control. Tellurium is used in ceramics. Bismuth telluride has been used in thermoelectric devices."

    "propertiesSummary": [
      "Crystalline tellurium has a silvery-white appearance, and when pure it exhibits a metallic luster. It is brittle and easily pulverized. Amorphous tellurium is found by precipitating tellurium from a solution of telluric or tellurous acid. Whether this form is truly amorphous, or made of minute crystals, is open to question. Tellurium is a p-type semiconductor, and shows greater conductivity in certain directions, depending on alignment of the atoms.Its conductivity increases slightly with exposure to light. It can be doped with silver, copper, gold, tin, or other elements. In air, tellurium burns with a greenish-blue flames, forming the dioxide. Molten tellurium corrodes iron, copper, and stainless steel."
