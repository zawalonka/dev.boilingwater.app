  "educationalNotes": "Demonstrates colligative properties - dissolved salt raises boiling point (+0.16°C) and lowers freezing point (-0.10°C). This is why ocean water doesn't freeze as easily as freshwater and why we add salt to icy roads in winter! Seawater is ~3.5% salt by mass (mostly NaCl). Saltwater conducts electricity (electrolyte) while pure water doesn't - dissolved Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions carry charge. Osmosis: cells in saltwater shrivel as water leaves to dilute the salty solution outside."
