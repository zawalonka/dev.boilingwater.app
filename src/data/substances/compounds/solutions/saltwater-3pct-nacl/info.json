  "educationalNotes": "Demonstrates colligative properties - dissolved salt raises boiling point (+0.515°C for 3% NaCl via van't Hoff factor i=1.9) and lowers freezing point (-1.87°C). This is why ocean water (≈3.5% salt) doesn't freeze as easily as freshwater and why we add salt to icy roads in winter! Saltwater conducts electricity (electrolyte) while pure water doesn't - dissolved Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions carry charge. Osmosis: cells in saltwater shrivel as water leaves to dilute the salty solution outside. KEY: NaCl dissociates into 2 ions, so i≈1.9 (not 1), making salt's effect on boiling/freezing points almost twice as strong as non-electrolytes like sugar!"
