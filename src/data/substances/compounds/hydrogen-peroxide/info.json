  "safetyNotes": "Household 3% solution is safe for skin contact; higher concentrations (>30%) are corrosive and explosive; decomposes into water and oxygen gas (foaming when applied to cuts)",
  "educationalNotes": "Boiling point 150°C - much higher than water! This is surprising given H₂O₂ is so similar to H₂O. Decomposes at high heat into 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂ (this is why it foams on wounds - catalase enzyme speeds decomposition, releasing oxygen bubbles). Store in dark containers - light accelerates decomposition.",
