## ⚠️ AI-Generated Code Warning

**This project is primarily AI-generated code developed collaboratively with GitHub Copilot and Claude.**

**Run at your own risk. Results may vary or be unsafe, even on the same system.** This codebase has not undergone professional security audit. There may be security vulnerabilities, bugs, or unsafe code patterns introduced during AI-assisted development. The developer cannot guarantee the code is safe or functions correctly.

- **Tested Environment:** Windows 11, VS Code, Node.js 18+ (but this does not guarantee safety)
- **Status:** Pre-Alpha (experimental, unaudited)
- **Known Risks:**
  - AI-generated code may contain security flaws
  - Behavior may be unpredictable across different systems
  - Even on tested systems, results may vary or fail
  - No warranty or guarantee of fitness for any purpose

**Use at your own risk. Review all code before execution. Report issues via GitHub Issues.**

## 🎯 Core Vision

Like Kerbal Space Program taught orbital mechanics through play, Boiling Water teaches thermodynamics and chemistry through experimentation. The game uses **real physics equations** and **empirical data**—no "game physics" simplifications.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The project is currently in **planning/early development phase**.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🎮 The Hook

Someone googles "how to boil water" → finds BoilingWater.app → gets an instant interactive tutorial → discovers water boils at 98°C (not 100°C!) at their altitude → curiosity triggered → learning begins.

## 📚 Key Features

- **Real Physics Only** - Uses actual thermodynamic equations (specific heat: 4.186 J/g°C, heat of vaporization: 2,257 kJ/kg)
- **Zero Gatekeeping** - No login, instant load, starts with plain English
- **Adaptive Language** - Gradually introduces technical terms as user progresses
- **Layered Complexity** - Simple interface for beginners, detailed physics panels for experts
- **Progressive Unlocking** - Complexity revealed based on user engagement

## 🎓 Educational Progression

- **Stage 0:** Just boil water (30-second experience)
- **Stage 1:** Why altitude matters
- **Stage 2:** Temperature control and precision
- **Stage 3:** Measurement accuracy
- **Stage 4+:** Energy, phase changes, and chemistry expansion

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Future Desktop:** Electron wrapper for Steam distribution
- **Why Web Tech:** This is a data visualization/simulation tool, not a traditional game
