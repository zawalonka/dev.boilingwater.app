# Boiling Water

**Tagline:** "Learn chemistry by doing it"

An interactive physics and chemistry learning game that teaches through experimentation, starting with the simplest task: boiling water.

## 🎯 Core Vision

Like Kerbal Space Program taught orbital mechanics through play, Boiling Water teaches thermodynamics and chemistry through experimentation. The game uses **real physics equations** and **empirical data**—no "game physics" simplifications.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The project is currently in **planning/early development phase**.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🎮 The Hook

Someone googles "how to boil water" → finds BoilingWater.app → gets an instant interactive tutorial → discovers water boils at 98°C (not 100°C!) at their altitude → curiosity triggered → learning begins.

## 📚 Key Features

- **Real Physics Only** - Uses actual thermodynamic equations (specific heat: 4.186 J/g°C, heat of vaporization: 2,257 kJ/kg)
- **Zero Gatekeeping** - No login, instant load, starts with plain English
- **Adaptive Language** - Gradually introduces technical terms as user progresses
- **Layered Complexity** - Simple interface for beginners, detailed physics panels for experts
- **Progressive Unlocking** - Complexity revealed based on user engagement

## 🎓 Educational Progression

- **Stage 0:** Just boil water (30-second experience)
- **Stage 1:** Why altitude matters
- **Stage 2:** Temperature control and precision
- **Stage 3:** Measurement accuracy
- **Stage 4+:** Energy, phase changes, and chemistry expansion

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Future Desktop:** Electron wrapper for Steam distribution
- **Why Web Tech:** This is a data visualization/simulation tool, not a traditional game
